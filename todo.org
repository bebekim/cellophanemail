** TODO URGENT: Privacy-Focused Email Architecture Implementation
   SCHEDULED: <2025-08-25>
   
   **PRIVACY PROBLEM:** Currently storing email content in database violates privacy principles for both opensource and commercial versions. 
   
   **SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE:**
   - Keep using Anthropic Claude API for now (Modal.com/Llama 3.1 8B postponed)
   - Ephemeral storage (process in memory, 5-minute auto-cleanup)
   - Metadata-only logging (hashed identifiers, no content)
   - Target performance: <3s processing time
   
   **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:**
   
   *** POSTPONED: Local LLM Integration via Modal.com
   DECISION: Continue using Anthropic API, postpone Modal.com/Llama 3.1 8B migration
   - [ ] Set up Modal.com account and Llama 3.1 8B deployment (POSTPONED)
   - [ ] Create Modal.com integration wrapper for existing LLM analyzer (POSTPONED)
   - [ ] Replace Anthropic API calls with Modal.com endpoint (POSTPONED)
   - [ ] Add fallback error handling for Modal.com API failures (POSTPONED)
   - [ ] Test performance benchmarks (target: <3s per email) (POSTPONED)
   - [ ] Verify technical feasibility of full migration path (POSTPONED)

** TODO DECIDED: No Database Storage Architecture
   SCHEDULED: <2025-08-25>
   
   **FINAL DECISION:** Pure in-memory processing with user's email provider as backup
   - No content stored in CellophoneMail database
   - Abusive emails archived to user's spam folder (via Gmail/Outlook API later)
   - Clean emails forwarded directly
   - Legal/privacy optimal approach accepted
   
   **ARCHITECTURE COMPLETED:**
   ✅ Designed complete in-memory workflow
   ✅ Identified all actors and components
   ✅ Created data structures (EphemeralEmail, ProcessingResult, MemoryManager)
   ✅ Defined processing pipeline: Webhook → Memory → LLM → Delivery → Cleanup
   
   **KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:**
   - 5-minute TTL for emails in memory
   - Max 50 concurrent emails to prevent memory exhaustion
   - 202 Accepted webhook response (async processing)
   - 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
   - Metadata-only logging (no content)
   
   *** PRIVACY COMPONENTS STATUS
   ✅ EphemeralEmail data class with TTL management (IMPLEMENTED)
   ✅ MemoryManager for lifecycle and capacity limits (IMPLEMENTED)
   ✅ InMemoryProcessor wrapper (uses existing LLM analyzer) (IMPLEMENTED)
   ✅ ImmediateDeliveryManager with retry logic (IMPLEMENTED)
   ✅ Basic unit tests for all privacy components (IMPLEMENTED)
   
   *** CURRENT STATUS (2025-08-27 - UPDATED)
   ✅ **PRIVACY INTEGRATION COMPLETE (TDD CYCLES 1-2):**
   - TDD CYCLE 1: PrivacyWebhookOrchestrator foundation complete
   - TDD CYCLE 2: WebhookController privacy mode integration complete
   - ProcessingStrategyManager routes based on PRIVACY_MODE environment variable
   - Privacy mode prevents ALL database content logging when enabled
   - End-to-end tests confirm privacy pipeline works correctly
   
   ✅ **PRIVACY MODE NOW WORKING:**
   - PRIVACY_MODE=true → Routes through PrivacyWebhookOrchestrator (202 Accepted)
   - PRIVACY_MODE=false → Uses normal EmailProtectionProcessor (200 OK)
   - Email subjects/addresses NO LONGER logged when privacy enabled
   - Backward compatibility maintained for existing installations
   
   📊 **UPDATED TEST STATUS:**
   - ✅ 37+ privacy-focused tests passing
   - ✅ End-to-end privacy integration tests passing
   - ✅ Privacy violations FIXED when PRIVACY_MODE=true
   - ⚠️  Normal mode still logs to database (by design for backward compatibility)
   - ⚠️  Processing time: Still 5-6 seconds (LLM API call is the bottleneck)
   
   🎯 **NEXT PRIORITIES (TDD CYCLE 3):**
   - Remove content logging COMPLETELY from storage.log_protection_decision()
   - Implement metadata-only logging even in normal mode
   - Create privacy-safe logging abstraction
   - This will make privacy the default, not just an option
   
   🔧 **REMAINING WORK:**
   1. TDD CYCLE 3: Database Content Logging Removal [HIGH PRIORITY]
   2. TDD CYCLE 4: Background Cleanup Task for expired emails
   3. TDD CYCLE 5: End-to-End Privacy Validation
   4. TDD CYCLE 6-12: Performance, Security, and Production hardening

   - [ ] `/src/cellophanemail/features/email_protection/llm_analyzer_bridge.py` - Bridge to preserve Anthropic
   
   **** Integration Points Architecture
   - [ ] Webhook Controller → PrivacyWebhookOrchestrator → MemoryManager
   - [ ] MemoryManager → InMemoryProcessor → Anthropic API (via LLMAnalyzerBridge)
   - [ ] ProcessingResult → ImmediateDeliveryManager → Postmark
   - [ ] Background Task → MemoryManager cleanup (5-minute TTL)
   - [ ] All components → MetadataLogger (no content, hashed identifiers only)
   
   **** Configuration Management
   - [ ] PRIVACY_MODE environment variable (true/false) to toggle privacy pipeline
   - [ ] MAX_CONCURRENT_EMAILS = 50 (memory capacity limit)
   - [ ] EMAIL_TTL_SECONDS = 300 (5-minute expiration)

   - [ ] Success/failure rates by protection action
   - [ ] API call latency and error rates
   - [ ] Privacy compliance audit logs (verify zero content)
   
   **** Critical Path Implementation Order
   1. TDD Cycle 1: Integration Foundation (PrivacyWebhookOrchestrator)
   2. TDD Cycle 2: Memory Manager singleton setup
   3. TDD Cycle 4: Database content removal
   4. TDD Cycle 6: LLM Analyzer Bridge (preserve Anthropic)
   5. TDD Cycle 7: Delivery integration
   6. TDD Cycles 8-11: Validation, security, and production readiness

** TODO Optimize Decision Thresholds
   - [ ] Current thresholds seem too strict (clean emails getting 0.218-0.322 toxicity)
   - [ ] Need to calibrate based on real LLM behavior patterns  
   - [ ] Adjust graduated decision boundaries for better accuracy
   - [ ] Test with more diverse email samples to find optimal boundaries

** TODO Performance & Cost Optimization
   - [ ] Real LLM calls are slow and expensive
   - [ ] Implement caching for similar emails
   - [ ] Consider temperature=0 for more deterministic responses in production
   - [ ] Add batch processing capabilities
   - [ ] Monitor API usage and costs

** TODO Production Readiness
   - [ ] Add rate limiting for API calls
   - [ ] Implement fallback strategies if LLM is unavailable
   - [ ] Add monitoring/logging for LLM response quality
   - [ ] Error handling and retry logic
   - [ ] Health checks and system status monitoring

** TODO Expand Test Coverage  
   - [ ] Build larger test suite with diverse languages/cultures
   - [ ] Add edge cases and boundary conditions
   - [ ] Create regression tests for known good/bad classifications
   - [ ] Test with real-world email samples from different domains
   - [ ] Add multilingual test cases (Korean, Spanish, etc.)

** TODO Feature Completeness
   - [ ] Implement actual redaction functionality (currently just marks content)
   - [ ] Add summarization capability using LLM
   - [ ] Build email forwarding with context injection
   - [ ] Add user preference settings for protection levels
   - [ ] Create admin dashboard for monitoring decisions

** TODO Email Forwarding Architecture - Shield Address Flow
   - [ ] Design proper email flow: User's email → Shield address → Analysis → Back to user
   - [ ] Implement email delivery back to user with original sender attribution (without spoofing)
   - [ ] Use Reply-To header for original sender email
   - [ ] Add X-Original-From custom header for transparency
   - [ ] Consider subject prefix or modified From field: "Sender via CellophoneMail"
   - [ ] Build processed email delivery function with protection result integration
   - [ ] Handle different protection actions (FORWARD_CLEAN, REDACT_HARMFUL, SUMMARIZE_ONLY)
   - [ ] Add toxicity score and horsemen detection info to delivered email
   
   **Architecture Options:**
   1. Manual forwarding: Users configure their email provider to forward ALL emails to shield address
   2. OAuth Integration: Direct access to monitor specific labels/folders and add processed emails back
   3. IMAP Integration: Poll user's inbox for emails matching patterns
   4. Webhook Integration: Gmail/Outlook webhooks for new emails
   
   **Key Challenge:** Can't selectively auto-forward "potentially abusive" emails from user's inbox
   **Solution:** Either use shield address as primary contact OR integrate directly with email provider
