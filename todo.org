* IN PROGRESS üöß

** TODO Optimize Decision Thresholds
   - [ ] Current thresholds seem too strict (clean emails getting 0.218-0.322 toxicity)
   - [ ] Need to calibrate based on real LLM behavior patterns  
   - [ ] Adjust graduated decision boundaries for better accuracy
   - [ ] Test with more diverse email samples to find optimal boundaries

** TODO Performance & Cost Optimization
   - [ ] Real LLM calls are slow and expensive
   - [ ] Implement caching for similar emails

   - [ ] Add batch processing capabilities
   - [ ] Monitor API usage and costs

** TODO Production Readiness
   - [ ] Add rate limiting for API calls
   - [ ] Implement fallback strategies if LLM is unavailable
   - [ ] Add monitoring/logging for LLM response quality
   - [ ] Error handling and retry logic
   - [ ] Health checks and system status monitoring

** TODO Expand Test Coverage
