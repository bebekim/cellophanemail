   - [ ] Build processed email delivery function with protection result integration
   - [ ] Handle different protection actions (FORWARD_CLEAN, REDACT_HARMFUL, SUMMARIZE_ONLY)
   - [ ] Add toxicity score and horsemen detection info to delivered email
   
   **Architecture Options:**
   1. Manual forwarding: Users configure their email provider to forward ALL emails to shield address
   2. OAuth Integration: Direct access to monitor specific labels/folders and add processed emails back
   3. IMAP Integration: Poll user's inbox for emails matching patterns
   4. Webhook Integration: Gmail/Outlook webhooks for new emails
   
   **Key Challenge:** Can't selectively auto-forward "potentially abusive" emails from user's inbox
   **Solution:** Either use shield address as primary contact OR integrate directly with email provider

* ARCHITECTURE NOTES 📝
** Privacy-First Architecture (Current)
   - Pure in-memory processing (zero content persistence)
   - Ephemeral email storage with 5-minute TTL
   - External delivery integration (Postmark/SMTP)
   - Metadata-only logging with hashed identifiers
   - Background cleanup with automated TTL management

** Email Processing Pipeline
   - Webhook → Memory (EphemeralEmail) → LLM Analysis → Delivery → Cleanup
   - IntegratedDeliveryManager for external email delivery
   - Circuit breaker pattern for service resilience
   - 202 Accepted response for async processing

** LLM Integration
   - Anthropic Claude API for Four Horsemen analysis
   - ConsolidatedLLMAnalyzer with unified interface
   - Dependency injection architecture
   - Performance target: <3 seconds per email

** SaaS Multi-tenancy
   - Organization-based isolation
   - User roles and permissions  
   - OAuth authentication (Google)
   - Australia/Melbourne timezone default

** Database Strategy
   - Piccolo ORM for native async operations
   - SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
   - Metadata-only storage (no email content)
   - Migration system for schema updates
