I reviewed your latest report and wanted to provide some feedback.

The analysis could be more thorough, and some of the conclusions seem rushed. Please take more time to review your work before submission.

We should discuss this further.

Your team completely failed to deliver what was promised. This kind of incompetence is exactly why I never should have trusted your company in the first place.

Fix this immediately or we're done.'''

Your pathetic attempts at being helpful are laughable. You never listen to anything I say, you always make excuses, and you're too stupid to understand basic concepts.
