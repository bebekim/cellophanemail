"""
Tests for streamlined email protection processor with real LLM integration.

These tests are designed for:
1. Single-pass LLM analysis (not multi-phase pipeline)
2. Empirically calibrated thresholds (not mock-based)
3. Probabilistic LLM behavior (range assertions, not exact matches)
4. Performance expectations (1-2 seconds, not 30+ seconds)
